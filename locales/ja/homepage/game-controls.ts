Use a power-up wrong, and it flops like a broken toy. A Freeze power-up holds the egg steady on steep climbs, like a superhero catching it mid-fall. A speed boost zooms you ahead, but a bad move sends the egg bouncing like a rubber ball. Kids chase these boosts for thrills, like hunting candy at a party.",
