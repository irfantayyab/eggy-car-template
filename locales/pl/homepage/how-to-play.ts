    "Too much brake, and the egg slides forward like a kid on a water slide. Too little, and it bounces like a ping-pong ball in a windstorm. Smooth driving, with eyes locked on the road, keeps the egg safe. The challenge hits hard from the jump. Roads get wilder, think steep hills like mountain peaks and bumps like speed humps on steroids. A careless move sends the egg crashing faster than a dropped phone. Speed up on climbs, ease off at peaks, brake softly downhill. That's the secret sauce for a long, safe ride that'll make you feel like a pro.",
